# •Sum•
__Cliptomania__ is a lightwight clip library, made to recreate [Clipboard](https://docs.microsoft.com/ru-ru/dotnet/api/system.windows.clipboard) API for [Nim](https://nim-lang.org/).  
Full compatibility is not prioritized at given moment, but desirable in future.  
❗ Currently only compiles on Windows systems ❗

# •Remark•
Since __Cliptomania__ was developed mainly for internal usage, no documentation will likely be included before v0.3.  
Provided examples and reading original .NET docs is a way to understand how to use this lib until then.
